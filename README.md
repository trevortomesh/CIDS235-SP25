# Lecture 1: Course Introduction and Overview

## **Course Overview**
Welcome to CS 235: Programming Paradigms, Spring 2025. This course focuses primarily on **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, the dominant paradigm in modern programming. While we will briefly touch on functional programming, the emphasis will be on OOP concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance, composition, and polymorphism.

If you are transitioning to Java from another programming language (e.g., Python), please let me know, as additional guidance may be necessary.

## **Syllabus Highlights**

### **Course Objectives**
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Develop software using advanced object-oriented programming concepts (e.g., encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).
- Describe the appropriate use cases for inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.
- Implement basic functional programming concepts, such as higher-order functions and callbacks.
- Compare programming paradigms across modern languages.

### **Grading Breakdown**
- **Assignments**: 40% (Three major project-based assignments)
- **Quizzes**: 40% (Five quizzes, multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank, 15-minute time limit)
- **Midterm Exam**: 10% (In-person, Scantron-based)
- **Final Exam**: 10% (Online, two hours)

### **Late Work Policy**
Assignments submitted after the deadline will incur a 5% penalty per day, up to a maximum deduction of 40%. The lowest grade for a late submission will be a D- (60%).

### **Office Hours**
Office hours are Monday and Friday, 3 PM - 5 PM (in-person or Zoom). Appointments can be scheduled via the provided link on Canvas. Walk-ins are welcome, but scheduled appointments take priority.

## **Living Textbook**
Lectures will be recorded and transcribed using AI to create a continuously updated **Living Textbook**, which will reflect our class discussion and key concepts. The Living Textbook is available on Canvas for reference. **Recordings are not published and are solely for generating lecture notes.** Students with accommodations may request recordings through appropriate channels. If you have concerns about this process, please let me know.

## **Use of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)**
Students are permitted to use tools such as ChatGPT under the following guidelines:
- **Cite Properly**: Any use of LLMs must be documented with proper citations. Refer to the LLM guide on Canvas for citation formats.
- **Restrictions**: LLMs cannot be used for exams unless explicitly permitted. Submissions entirely generated by LLMs will receive a zero, but proper citation will avoid academic misconduct charges.
- **Keep Records**: Retain chat logs as proof of LLM use and prompts.

## **AI-Assisted Grading Pilot**
This course uses an AI-assisted grading tool to provide consistent, timely feedback on assignments. Participation is optional:
- To opt out, include the statement: "I do not consent to AI-assisted grading" at the top of your assignment.
- All grades, whether AI-assisted or manual, will be reviewed and finalized by the instructor to ensure fairness and quality.

## **Software Requirements**
We will use **JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA** (free for students) as the primary IDE for this course. Instructions for setting up IntelliJ are available on Canvas. Alternative editors such as VS Code are permitted, but IntelliJ will be the only officially supported IDE.

---

## **Key Resources**
- **Class Notes**: Lecture notes and supplemental materials will be updated live on Canvas after each class.
- **Class Code Repository**: All in-class coding examples will be pushed to a GitHub repository, accessible via Canvas.
- **Coding Guide**: A detailed coding guide is available, including expectations for commenting and formatting code. You are encouraged to use tools like ChatGPT to generate JavaDoc-style comments.

---

## **Additional Notes**
- **Program Write-Up Documents**: For assignments, you will be required to submit a written program summary. Templates (Markdown and Word) will be provided.
- **Markdown and UML**: Basic Markdown and Unified Modeling Language (UML) will be introduced to aid in documentation and visualizing software design.

## **Practice Questions**
To help you refresh your Java skills, here are a few practice questions based on concepts you should have learned in prior courses
These are NOT graded they are for your own practice:

1. **Data Types**:  
   Write a Java program that declares and initializes variables of the following types: `int`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`. Print each variable's value to the console.

2. **Arrays**:  
   Write a Java method `sumArray(int[] numbers)` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements in the array. Test the method with the array `{4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42}`.

3. **Control Flow**:  
   Write a Java program that uses a `for` loop to print the even numbers from 1 to 20.
