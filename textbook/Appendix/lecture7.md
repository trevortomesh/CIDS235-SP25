# **CIDS 235: Object-Oriented Battle Creatures & Program Write-Up Document (PWUD)**
### *Lecture: February 10, 2025*

## **Homework Assignment Update**
The **Object-Oriented Battle Creatures (A1)** assignment is now available. Make sure to check Canvas for the full details. If you couldnâ€™t see the assignment earlier, that issue has now been fixed.

## **What is the Program Write-Up Document (PWUD)?**
If youâ€™ve had me before, youâ€™re already familiar with this. If not, hereâ€™s the quick version:  
Instead of submitting raw code, youâ€™ll submit a **structured document (PDF)** explaining your program. This helps reinforce good documentation practices while also making grading easier (and safer).

### **PWUD Requirements:**
1. **Brief Explanation of the Program** â€“ What does it do?
2. **UML Diagram** â€“ A simple sketch of your class structure.
3. **Discussion of Key Components** â€“ Explain how you met the assignmentâ€™s requirements.
4. **Screenshots of Your Program Running** â€“ Show it works.
5. **Formatted Java Code in an Appendix** â€“ No raw files, just neatly pasted code.
6. **References (if applicable)** â€“ If you use any external sources, cite them properly.

ðŸ‘‰ *If your program isnâ€™t working, you can still get most of the points by clearly explaining what you did and what went wrong.*

## **Markdown vs. Word for PWUDs**
- **Markdown (Preferred)** â€“ Easier formatting, especially for code. Works in IntelliJ, Typora, or online tools like Dillinger.io.
- **Word (.docx)** â€“ Acceptable but can be tricky with code formatting. If using Word, ensure your code is properly styled and readable.

## **Final Notes**
- Make sure to follow the **JavaDoc** style for commenting your code.
- AI tools like ChatGPT can help with documentation, but you **must acknowledge** any AI-generated content in your write-up.
- If you want full points (95%), meet all the requirements. To hit **100%**, go **beyond expectations**â€”add something extra and **explicitly state** what it is.

### **Next Class:**
Weâ€™ll go over PlantUML for generating UML diagrams and answer any lingering questions.
