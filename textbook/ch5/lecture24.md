# CS 235 — Inheritance, Polymorphism, and the Object Class
### March 31, 2025

---

## Summary
In this lecture, we continued building on our understanding of object-oriented programming by revisiting the custom `MyStack` class and introducing two major pillars of OOP: **inheritance** and **polymorphism**. We discussed how these concepts relate to Java’s `Object` class and used a biological taxonomy metaphor to illustrate hierarchical class relationships. We also previewed how geometric shapes like `Rectangle` and `Circle` can inherit shared behaviors and attributes from a common superclass, `GeometricObject`.

## Review: The Stack Class

We started by reviewing the custom `MyStack` class built on March 28. This stack:
- Is a **first-in, last-out** (FILO) data structure.
- Was implemented using an `ArrayList<Object>`.
- Included methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `isEmpty()`, and `getSize()`.

The `ArrayList` stores `Object`s, which allows it to hold any reference type (e.g., `Cat`, `Circle`, `Loan`). However, this generality introduces a limitation: we lose access to the specific methods of each object type unless we cast them.

## Introduction to Polymorphism

We introduced **polymorphism** first (unusual, but effective in this context). The word comes from Greek:
- **Poly** = many
- **Morph** = form

Polymorphism means *many forms*. There are two main kinds of polymorphism:
1. **Method Overloading** (compile-time polymorphism)
2. **Object Polymorphism** (runtime polymorphism)

### Example: Method Overloading
```java
public class Circle {
    public Circle() {}
    public Circle(double radius) {}
}
```
Both are `Circle` constructors, but with different parameter lists. This is a form of **compile-time polymorphism**.

## Inheritance and the Object Class

Every class in Java implicitly or explicitly inherits from the `Object` class:

- The `Object` class provides methods like `.toString()`, `.equals()`, `.getClass()`, `.hashCode()`, etc.
- These are available to every object, even if not explicitly written in the class.

We saw this when we printed an object directly:
```java
System.out.println(catGuy); // Output: Cat@6e8cf4c6
```
This output is generated by `toString()`, inherited from the `Object` class.

## Inheritance Analogy: Biological Taxonomy

To explain inheritance, we used **taxonomy** as an analogy:

- **Specific instances** (like individual cats) inherit traits from broader classifications.
- For example: `Susu` is a `Cat`, which is a `Carnivore`, which is a `Mammal`, which is a `Chordate`, which is an `Animal`.
- Similarly: `Circle` is a `GeometricObject`, which is an `Object`.

This idea of "is-a" relationships is foundational to inheritance:
- A `Circle` **is a** `GeometricObject`
- A `Rectangle` **is a** `GeometricObject`
- Both inherit shared properties from `GeometricObject`

---

## Designing an Inheritance Hierarchy
We introduced the idea of using inheritance to reduce redundancy:

### Step 1: GeometricObject Class (Super Class)
- Common attributes: `color`, `filled`
- Common methods: `getColor()`, `setColor()`, etc.

### Step 2: Extend This Class
```java
public class Circle extends GeometricObject { ... }
public class Rectangle extends GeometricObject { ... }
```

This lets us:
- Avoid rewriting shared features in every shape class
- Take advantage of polymorphism: we can treat all geometric shapes as `GeometricObject`s when needed

---

## Conclusion
Today, we:
- Reviewed how stacks work and why they're essential
- Introduced **polymorphism**: the ability to refer to many object types as one
- Explained **inheritance** using both Java code and biological taxonomy
- Previewed our upcoming class hierarchy with `GeometricObject`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`

These concepts are foundational for understanding **reusability**, **flexibility**, and **extensibility** in object-oriented design.

Next time, we’ll continue building our geometric object hierarchy and explore how to override methods like `toString()` and `equals()` to better control object behavior.

## Optional Exercises

1. Create a new class `Triangle` that extends `GeometricObject`. What shared properties should it inherit?
2. Override the `toString()` method in the `Rectangle` class to provide a custom string output.
3. Explain the difference between `Object obj = new Circle()` and `Circle c = new Circle()`.
4. Draw a UML diagram that shows the inheritance hierarchy between `Object`, `GeometricObject`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`.
5. What happens if you try to call a `Circle`-specific method on an object declared as type `Object`? How can you fix this?
